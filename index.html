                        <p class= "discription"><b>Thomas Alva Edison (February 11, 1847 – October 18, 1931) was an American 
                        inventor and businessman who has been described as America's greatest inventor.
                        He developed many devices in fields such as electric power generation, mass communication,
                        sound recording, and motion pictures.He was one of the first inventors to apply the principles
                        of organized science and teamwork to the process of invention, working with many researchers and employees.
                        He established the first industrial research laboratory.Thomas Edison was born in 1847 in Milan, Ohio, but
                        grew up in Port Huron, Michigan, after the family moved there in 1854. He was the seventh and last child of
                        Samuel Ogden Edison Jr. (1804–1896, born in Marshalltown, Nova Scotia) and Nancy Matthews Elliott (1810–1871,
                        born in Chenango County, New York State).His patrilineal family line was Dutch by way of New Jersey;[10] the 
                        surname had originally been "Edeson".Edison developed hearing problems at the age of 12. The cause of his deafness
                        has been attributed to a bout of scarlet fever during childhood and recurring untreated middle-ear infections. He
                        subsequently concocted elaborate fictitious stories about the cause of his deafness.[14] Being completely deaf in
                        one ear and barely hearing in the other, it is alleged that Edison would listen to a music player or piano by clamping
                        his teeth into the wood to absorb the sound waves into his skull.[15] As he got older, Edison believed his hearing
                        loss allowed him to avoid distraction and concentrate more easily on his work. Modern-day historians and medical
                        professionals have suggested he may have had ADHD.[13]</b></p>
